## Dataset

First Download the [Driving Datasets](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car/tree/master/datasets) â€“ Over 10 hours of driving data (LIDAR, camera frames and more)

```
aria2c Ch2_001.tar.gz-692ee7e0c63fb2212bfe4a62a39ce71ee9b16fb3.torrent
```

Untar

```
tar -xf Ch2_001.tar.gz
```

## [udacity-driving-reader](https://github.com/rwightman/udacity-driving-reader)

Build the docker
```
docker build -t udacity-reader .
```
Run the ROS bag reader
```
./run-bagdump.sh -i /data -o /output
```

## [allow-public-access-amazon-bucket](https://havecamerawilltravel.com/photographer/how-allow-public-access-amazon-bucket/)

Access Photos from Python, by building a list ([save list to CSV](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-save-list-to-csv/))
```python
import os
import pandas as pd
list = os.listdir()
df = pd.DataFrame(list,columns=['photo'])
df.to_csv('photos.csv',index=False)
```

Display frames & steering angle with a streamlit app:
